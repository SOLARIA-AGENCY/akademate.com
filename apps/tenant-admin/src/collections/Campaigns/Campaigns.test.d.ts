/**
 * Campaigns Collection - Comprehensive Test Suite (TDD - RED PHASE)
 *
 * This test suite follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology:
 * 1. Write tests FIRST (RED phase) ✅ YOU ARE HERE
 * 2. Implement collection to pass tests (GREEN phase)
 * 3. Apply security patterns (REFACTOR phase)
 *
 * Coverage Areas:
 * - CRUD Operations (15+ tests)
 * - Validation Tests (25+ tests)
 * - Access Control Tests (18+ tests)
 * - Relationship Tests (12+ tests)
 * - Hook Tests (15+ tests)
 * - Security Tests (15+ tests)
 * - Business Logic Tests (20+ tests)
 * Total: 120+ comprehensive tests
 *
 * Security Focus:
 * - SP-001: Immutable fields (created_by, system-calculated metrics)
 * - SP-004: No PII in logs (campaigns don't contain PII but budget is sensitive)
 * - Business intelligence protection (budget, ROI data)
 * - Ownership-based permissions (Marketing role)
