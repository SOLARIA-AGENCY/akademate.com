# DEPLOYMENT COMPLETION REPORT
Date: February 18, 2026
Target: NEMESIS (100.99.60.106)

## Status: SUCCESS
The Akademate platform has been successfully built and deployed to the staging environment on the remote server.

## Verified Services
1.  **Web App (Portal):**
    - Port: 3006
    - Status: HTTP 200 OK
    - Nginx Proxy: Port 8088 (HTTP 200 OK)
2.  **Admin Client (Ops):**
    - Port: 3004
    - Status: HTTP 307 Redirect (to /login) - Correct behavior
3.  **Payload CMS (API):**
    - Port: 3003
    - Status: HTTP 200 OK (/admin)

## Key Fixes Applied
- **Edge Runtime:** Disabled stateful rate-limiting in `middleware.ts` to fix build errors.
- **Docker:** Switched from `standalone` output to standard `pnpm start` to resolve `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors.
- **Ports:** Remapped Nginx to 8088/8443 to avoid conflict with existing services on port 80.
- **Dependencies:** Added missing `socket.io-client`, AWS SDKs, and config files to Docker contexts.

## Next Steps
- Monitor logs for runtime errors (observed `TypeError` on `/cursos` route in Web app).
- Restore rate-limiting using Redis (instead of in-memory Map) for production.
